The use of Stripe Connect to create a payment platform isn't as well documented as I'd like.  

Here's a bit of code that walks you through the whole process from the start - 

+ The OAuth flow
+ Creating a customer
+ Saving their credit card
+ Charging the customer
+ Creating a connect customer
+ Charging the connect customer
+ Updating the connect customer's credit card

+ Charging somebody via Connect without saving the customer
